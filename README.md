The goal was to run an online clothing store with at least four products that could be added or withdrawn. Products would have a variety of displayable attributes, such as price and name. Customers should be able to search for the goods and see the order of various aspects such as high to low, new to old, and so on. The online clothing company is a sporting goods retailer that sells yard goat coats, jerseys, socks, and beanies. In the shop, there would be roughly 10,000 different types of merchandise. To save money and operate the store more efficiently online, the entire store would be created in IntelliJ's IDE to perform all the operations. The current program design consists of one product superclass, four product subclasses, one catalogue class and one drive class. Furthermore, the program design would include a variety of different types of filters such as sort A to Z, Z to A, price low to high, high to low, color and, size.
